# Neural-network-on-the-Gurmukhi-dataset

Implement a neural network on the Gurmukhi dataset and implement the following regularization
techniques from scratch:
1. L-1 regularization
   
2. L-2 regularization

3. Dropout
   
Compare the performance of the above techniques and mention reasons to support your
answer. You are free to utilize PyTorch's inbuilt functions for implementing activation and loss
functions. However, various regularization techniques must be implemented from scratch
without the support of any library.
Also, implement gradient checking (from scratch) to verify the values of gradients during
backpropagation.
